# The Web Playbook

The place to discuss best practices and workflows for web technologies at Agens.

## Why we need it?

> To do great work we have to grow, through leaning.

That's why we need a place where we can share knowledge, discuss ideas, learn from each other and develop best practices that we can apply. 

# How to contribute?

## Open an issue  
If you have an idea or question you want to discuss, just open a new issue.

### Take part in conversations
We should all take part in discussions, be open to share our point of views and to learn new things.
